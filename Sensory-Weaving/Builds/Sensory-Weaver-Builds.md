# Sensory Weaver Builds
This is a list of resources to external builds of hardware that can do sensory weaving. Be it studies from acedemia, companies, or makers/DIY hackers. An attempt to catalog, for future reference in design and iterations for others looking to explore the space of possibilities.

# Professional
People, teams who *actually* know what they are doing and have hard studies, science to back it up.


## The Voice
[The vOICe](https://seeingwithsound.com)
a visual->auditory experience. See the world of edges, lights, textures and more over tones and pitch shifts. A symphony of visual information.

## Seeing With The Hands
[Seeing With The Hands](https://seeingwiththehands.com)
Turns depth sensor data into electro-tactile display feedback. Scan around enviroments, feeling an outline of the world around. 

## Haptic Patches
[Haptic Tactile Patches](https://techxplore.com/news/2024-11-haptic-patch-transmits-complexity-skin.html)
A trypophobia inducing haptic patch able to transmit not just vibration, but pinch, twist and more. 

## Neosensory
[Neosensory](https://neosensory.com)
(rip).  Used to be a product sold to enable auditory->haptic sensory substitution. Bought out, along with 70+ things in the works. May see these arise from others someday.

## Unfolding Space Glove
[Unfolding Space Glove](https://github.com/jakobkilian/unfolding-space)
A glove-based sensory substitution device, giving depth information to haptic feedback.

## FeelSpace Haptic Belt
[Feelspace Belt](https://feelspace.de/en/)
A haptic compass, but as a product.

## Haplets
[Haplets: Finger-Worn Haptics](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/virtual-reality/articles/10.3389/frvir.2021.738613/full)
finger based haptic feedback - mostly for VR, but also would work for sensory weaving.

## Haptic Primary Colors
[Haptic Primary Colors](https://tachilab.org/en/about/hpc.html)
Enables a sense of colours to those even without sight.

## TactorBots
[TactorBots](https://www.ranzhourobot.com/tactorbots)
Modular mutli-haptic style system for exploring interfaces. Not quite for sensory weaving, but also again should work well enough depending on needs.

## ThermalSense
[ThermalSense](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3733048)
Thermal->Auditory sensory augmentation device.

# Hackers/DIY
A bit more loose and exploratory, but that shouldn't detract from the capabilities afforded, or perspectives found.


## Lockpick mk2
[Lockpick mk2](https://curiosiate.com/sensory-weaver-mk2-lockpick/)
By Curiosiate, this wristband device turns modular sensor data into haptic feedback.

## Visual Impairment Aid
[Visual Impairment Aid](https://www.instructables.com/VIA-Visual-Impairment-Aid-Haptic-Sound-Feedbac/)
turn ultrasonic distance into tactile vibrations.

## Pigeon Belt
[Pigeon Belt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRChZkY1ff0)
a haptic compass belt project

## SomaOS 
more resources when available - found in a biohacker's discord group.
Glove, hand/finger based.

## NorthPaw
[NorthPaw](https://web.archive.org/web/20220628061346/https://sensebridge.net/)

## BottleNose
[BottleNose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voGVwniAL7Y)
An ultrasonic distance sensor to haptic feedback device. Oldschool cool. 

## A Haptic Timekeeping Device
[Timeekping Device](https://courses.ideate.cmu.edu/48-339/f2019/index.html%3Fp=1013.html)
Turn time into vibrations, gain heightened intuitive sense of chronology?

# Resources
These don't quite fit under builds, but are still useful if working towards building a sensory weaver as a basic resource. (there is a lot in *other* areas of study that also play in, but that is for later)

# Integration Resources
These aren't directly on a build, but more onto the usage of the devices. This may get split off into its own page eventually.
