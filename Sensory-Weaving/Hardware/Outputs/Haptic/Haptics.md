# Overview
There are various types of haptic output devices, the most common for wearables at least in terms of price will be vibration based feedback. 

There may be need to determine the correct output based on need of feedback and relevant [Neurospec](https://wiki.curiosiate.com/Sensory-Weaving/Neurospec/Neurospec.md)


# Vibration
Haptics using vibration can modulate and encode information over 3 main modalities of discernment, based on different sensors and perceptual biases - these are rough guidelines, but not hard and fast because the mind and perception is pliable.
[HapticLabs.io](https://www.hapticlabs.io/showcase/haptics-in-our-smartphones) has a good overview of the differences of feedback types.

## ERMs 
Or, eccentric rotating mass - these haptics have slower spin up time, and less control over frequency and shaping of feedback to the end user. 
**Pros**
Cheap, easy to power and drive with basic DC signal at different voltage levels. 
**Cons**
Slow response time



## LRAs
these are more complex to drive, signal wise. They allow greater control by using A/C to drive, and this allows inverting the signal to bring the moving mass to a stop with much higher response and precision. (known as braking)

**Pros**
wideband frequency response - can provide many more points of articulation within the sensory thread crafted
braking - ability to slice up signals at even higher rates, like having a high refresh rate monitor


**Cons**
requires an A/C signal to fully take advantage while driving. 
Needs custom drivers/circuit to run, which can be larger footprint if not going custom PCB.
