# Sensory Weaving Software
In order to do sensory weaving in more modular form, most the work so far will be doing sensory weaving over a backend firmware/software architecture designed to mimic a modular synthesizer. This is a work in progress, but generally will allow for a more flexible approach to modulating perceptual manifolds via weaving in new sensory lattices constructed via software in a more standardized format. 
However, there can be cases for single purpose or more streamlined sensory weaving tools. So in the futre those may be here.
